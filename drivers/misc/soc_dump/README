This directory contains a set of modules that provide an interface for
a user space application to retrieve the contents of a selected set of
hardware/firmware registers.

The kernel portion of the register dumping utility is spilt into
multiple modules.

Each chip/set of registers will have a separate module that will
be responsible for reading the registers and reporting thier contents to
the main module that makes the information available to user via
debugfs file /sys/kernel/debug/dump_registers.

The register information is returned as a binary blob containing an
array of reg_info structs (see register_info.h)

socdump.c provides an API for the register dump modules to
register themselves as a source of register information.
(see socdump.h)

Each register source module is responsible fo ensuring that the
chip/registers it plans to report are present on the platform before
registering itself as an information source.

When the debugfs file is opened by the user space application the
current register information is collected from all the registered
sources. The user app can then read the register information.

The simplest output utility is od using the command:
    od -t x4 /sys/kernel/debug/dump_registers

The last dword on the ouput line is the hexidecimal representation of
the register contents.

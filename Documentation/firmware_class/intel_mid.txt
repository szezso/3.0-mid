This document describes the native firmware update process for
updating various system firmware components on Intel Medfield based
embedded platforms.

Firmware update is initiated by usre space via sysfs interface. All
subsequent communications with system controller Inter-Processor
Communication (IPC) driver are based on standard firmware class
loading mechanism.

As of today, two images are required to perform the update:
   1) DnX modules, which is a executable module for the system
   controller unit (SCU)
   2) Integrated Firmware Image (IFW)

The future process may not require DnX module but such feature require
newer firmware.

Assumptions:
	Intel SCU IPC driver loaded (CONFIG_INTEL_SCU_IPC)

Usage:
	1) load dnx image

	echo dnx > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:01.7/image_type
	echo 1 > /sys/class/firmware/0000\:00\:01.7/loading
	cat dnx.bin > /sys/class/firmware/0000\:00\:01.7/data
	echo 0 > /sys/class/firmware/0000\:00\:01.7/loading

	2) load ifwi image, then system resets
	echo ifwi > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:01.7/image_type
	echo 1 > /sys/class/firmware/0000\:00\:01.7/loading
	cat ifwi.bin > /sys/class/firmware/0000\:00\:01.7/data
	echo 0 > /sys/class/firmware/0000\:00\:01.7/loading

Note:
	This can be automated based on uevent emitted by SCU IPC
	driver at probing time.
